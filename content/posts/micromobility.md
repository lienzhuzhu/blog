Millions of Americans suffer from CDS which forces them to lug around 2 ton tumors around dozens of miles every day. Car Dependency Syndrome plagues the free states.

I grew up in a Midwest suburb all my life. If you asked me when I was a kid what I imagined for my future, I would have said I wanted to be rich so I could move to an even better suburb, with more green space for my nuclear family to enjoy, polished off with a huge garage that could showcase my pristine, luxury vehicles. 

As seems to be the theme of my life, younger me was misguided once again.

### The Revelation

The American Dream has been purported to be something of the sort: move to the US where if you work an honest job or make a neat business you are drawn by media's pull to move to the suburbs with your wife and kids where you can barbeque and play with your dog in your spacious backyard, where all the space represents American freedom. When you come back home from the job financing this facade, say hello to your friendly (white) neighbor standing on the porch of his house that looks the same as yours and catch up on each other's insights of the local sports teams. Rinse and repeat until retirement. The latest iteration might describe something about investing enough to retiring early, who knows. But even retiring early is not as good as it sounds unless you were born into wealth, which means you didn't need to dream in the first place, you were born into the Universal Dream.

But this post is about the USA's car culture and its terrible implementation of suburbs. This post is about the irony of how millions of Americans are practically caged within a fish tank of monotonous, cheaply built single family homes that spit in the face of the dream of American expression and the explorer's spirit. 

Why do I say that suburbs "cage" people in? Because to get out of most suburbs in the US, you need to drive. Owning a car is prohibitive to many. First, you have to purchase or lease a vehicle, pay car insurance, annual property taxes in some states, annual registration, gas, maintenance, parking, etc. All that just to drive to work. People who don't own cars in suburb adjacent areas have to rely on sketchy public transportation that drops them off a mile from their workplace after a 30 minute transit time for a total of an hour spent on their commute. And the walking leg of that trip is on the measly little sidewalk of a stroad with the car commuters flying by them at 45 miles an hour.

What is a stroad? A street and road combined, often with speed limits around 40mph, 4 to 6 lanes flanked by high class establishments such as McDonalds and the local strip mall, decorated with lovely signage for drivers to marvel. Nevermind the fact that these signs are always built large enough for Goliath to hide behind. The people lucky enough to own a car funnel into stroads everyday on their way to work. Stroads were originally designed with so many lanes to speed up commutes, yet by widening these streets into ineffective roads, local politicians at the mercy of the car industry's lobbyists made traffic worse. The effect of widening streets is similar to the effect of a blood vessel ballooning before an aneurysm, more cars rush to the area and everything stops.

This revelation against American suburbs hit me when I graduated college and moved out of my convenient college town, which admittedly is not very convenient for grocery shopping but still beats the suburbs, and moved to what is supposed to be one of the world's tech hubs. When my family would visit China, I abhorred having to use public transportation. I hated being scrunched in between so many people and having to wait the eternity of 5 minutes for the subway to arrive. I longed to return to the States where my parents could drive me around. Now that I have to maintain my own car and pray on the highway and stroads that other people are paying attention, I would do anything to be in a city that invests in public transport and micromobility solutions like Chinese cities and suburbs.


### Suburbs and Sprawling Cities

American cities might as well be suburbs given the dismal state of public transport infrastructure. In LA, it took me 20 minutes to go 2 miles on a highway, a distance that should take 2 minutes assuming 60mph. Why do I have to take a $100 Uber from an iconic stadium to the campus of one of the greatest technological universities in the world? Shouldn't there be some sort of bus line or elevated train between those spots? The sprawl of LA has disqualified it as a city in my opinion.

Before I moved to my current residence in one of the world's tech hubs, I expected fantastic, modern public transportation only to be greeted with rocky freeways and more stroads like LA. The buses and trains are not bad actually, but once you step off those vehicles, I have to fend off stimulant nestled homeless people, another product of single family housing. I am tired of driving. 

The only city that the US can present against those of Europe and Asia is the Big Apple. But even NYC is being sliced open by freeways, bleached by gentrification, and spilling density. But for now, it is still walkable thanks to the MTA and high density.


### Why Urbanization and Suburb Revitalization

Urban areas cost less for city governments to finance, promote actually knowing your neighbors, and, against intuition, denser neighborhoods are better for the environment. Also, they look better. Just compare any stroad to Chicago's urban parks or NYC's character. This whole post is just a regurgitation of studies so if you want verification and direct sourcing, refer to the sources discussed by these YouTube channels below. Just as I came to the realization that I will only live in walkable cities, YouTube recommended Not Just Bikes, which catalyzed a deep dive into urban planning and how poor this American Nightmare is compared to European and Asian cities. I've provided links to YouTube channels with videos on the topic of urbanization and suburban revitalization.

To be clear, I'm not advocating for getting rid of suburbs and shoving everyone in a small apartment like a New York subway train at 7 in the morning on a Monday. But we do need to advocate for mixed-use buildings, public transportation, and reduced dependency on cars. I am convinced the only real need for cars is for... well, I can't actually think of an instance where high speed rail or better designed cities would fall to cars. The only reason I can think of is for car enthusiasts, but I don't understand that hobby. Cars are loud and expensive and the enthusiasm for collecting them and racing them stems from marketing just like Valentine's day was made by card makers. To me, racing and collecting cars is as absurd as collecting towels and excessively washing one's hands to use them. Cars were designed as upgraded utilities above the horse and carriage. Utilities for function. Of course, the main problem is the sprawl of American cities. Densifying cities would allow us to walk to work, and densified suburbs would make small rail and buses more feasible. Then adding public transportation to further out offices in business parks would also make sense.

This post is getting long. I'm not an expert but all I can say is the US has a suburban nightmare. We need more mixed-use buildings and densification for our communities to thrive again.

In short here are the benefits of reducing car dependency:
- Cars are bad for the environment. Buses and rail are not.
- Cars are expensive. Parking, oil changes, gas etc.
- Walking is free. Public transport is cheap.
- Community. People in American suburbs don't know their neighbors.

We need:
- Transit oriented cities
- Higher density neighborhoods
- Mixed use buildings

As a kid, I always thought about getting a nice job so I could buy the nice cars that would impress my friends and showcase outside my big house with a lawn so big I would have to use binoculaurs to see my mailbox. But now, all I can think about is how many days are left until I can sell my car and move to a real city and never be caught in pacific or mountain time again.
