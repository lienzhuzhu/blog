When I watch YouTube videos of other computer scientists and software engineers I can't help but admire their sleek, clean development environment setups. They give off an air of control and mastery, having tamed their machines to which I could only heed my wit.

So, I have decided to work on setting up my own dotfiles more or less from scratch.

## Goals

- Each application installed must use an easy to read/ modify config file
- Each application installed must be compatible with MacOS and Ubuntu
- Write an `install.sh` script

## Key applications:

### Window Manager
TODO

### Terminal Emulator
[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)


## Dependencies

- Rust
- Having some Nerd Font installed, I recommend just cloning the entire [repo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) and using the install script
- Packer 
- ripgrep
