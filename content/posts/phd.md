### Reasons why I am pursuing a PhD in CSE

- I ask too many questions that can only be answered by research
- I have a tendency to be skeptical of accepted truths
- I am an explorer (as described by one of the tech leads I worked with at Boeing)
- I've found that industry finds local maxima and exploits them until no longer lucrative. No questions asked until then. Research strives towards global maxima, step by step questioning the whole way. Reflecting on my master's research and time in industry as an engineer, I've realized I am a global guy.
