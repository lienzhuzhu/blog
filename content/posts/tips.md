### Helpful Advice for My Brothers

- Make smart, calm decisions. Take the time to write things down and challenge any assumptions you might be unconsciously making. Talk things through with someone you trust. I have made many suboptimal decisions because I felt rushed or pressured myself and didn't do thorough analysis or allowed irrelevant factors into my analysis.
- Be picky with who you share your time and energy with. Not everyone is your friend (though you can call people friend to be polite). Who you call your close friends should be an exclusive label.
- Never artificially limit your options early in life. My biggest mistake was studying biology in college. This limited my career options and gave me an uphill battle to fight against. 
- Always have an exit strategy
- Don't be jealous of others. People only show you the good things that happen in life and when you get to know them you will find they are envious of things you have (even though they might not exlicitly say this, it may come in the form of manipulation). 99% of people I've met who are materialistic or advertise their lifestyle are miserable.
- Owning a car and driving is one of the biggest physical, mental, and financial risks you can make. Many Americans drive their life away. Try to form a life that doesn't require a car.
- The choice is more important than the effort. Working hard on the wrong path is wasted effort.
- You should surround yourself with people better than you. However, don't be discouraged to pursue a path just because there are people better than you also pursuing that path. It is highly likely those people are just super outliers and you are in fact in the top 5% of students or figures in that industry, and the people you admire are in the top 0.1%. Rather than feel overwhelmed by them, appreciate the fact that you are able to be friends with them.


### Practical (More Specific) Advice
- Control risk (make sure you can cover any risk you take on i.e. always leverage risk). You might say "wait, if I don't take risks I won't succeed. I will always be mediocre like everyone else." That is true, but not what I'm saying. If you overextend your risk you will find yourself in an anxious position and won't be able to achieve anything great. For example, I foolishly visited Seattle for a year to work for a boring company. 
- Building off the last tip, it's best to live with parents or split rent with a friend you get along with living together to save as much money and build a stable foundation.
    - Rent is expensive so if I lost my job I would not have been able to cover rent, whereas in a cheaper city I would be able to cover rent with savings. 
    - It's far from family and friends which left me with no support group if needed.
