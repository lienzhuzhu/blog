### Thoughts to ponder

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

\- Steve Jobs, _Whole Earth Catalog_

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

\- Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, _The Little Prince_

Failing to plan is planning to fail.

\- Mr. Brian Martz, my high school shop and engineering teacher

"People where you live," the little prince said, "grow five thousand roses in one garden... yet they don't find what they're looking for..."

\- Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, _The Little Prince_

Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.

\- Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, _Sherlock Holmes_

It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.

\- Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, _The Little Prince_

When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.

\- Steve Jobs
